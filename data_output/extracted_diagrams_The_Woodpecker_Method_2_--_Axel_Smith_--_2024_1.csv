One reason is that the knight on d2 does not exert pressure on d5, and would be better on c3. The fact that White has committed to e2-e3 also helps Black in two ways: it prevents the c1- bishop from going to g5, and it means that the f1-bishop is likely heading for e2 rather than g2. (The kingside fianchetto is considered optimal against the IQP structure, as it fortifies the kingside while enabling the bishop to exert pressure against d5.)","black","","","data_output/extracted_images/diagram_226_page_197.png","197","196","197"

To release the tension against the knight, Black often chases the bishop on b5 with ...a7-a6 and ...b7-b5 (before White is ready to take on c6). If Black can follow up with ...c7-c5, the queenside expansion can be a strength; otherwise it may be a weakness which White can exploit by a2-a4. Thus, after ...a7-a6 and ...b7-b5, the knight on c6 must move. Redeveloping with ...Nb8-d7 is one way, but to avoid losing time Black usually choses ...Na5, hitting the bishop on b3. That is what we have here - but this is an unusual version with Black’s bishop on g4. (Normally White prevents it with h2-h3.) 15.d5! The knight is out of play on a5 and White has scored tremendously at the top level.

The engines consider 11...Bb7 to be of equal strength, but the verdict of decades of grandmaster practice is unquestionable. Black’s main plan is to play for hanging pawns with ...c7-c5, dxc5 and ...bxc5, which opens the b-file. On b7, the bishop would stop ...Qb7 and make ...Rab8 less effective. To hide the bishop on a8 is not ideal either.
