White would like to attack and leave the weak pawn to its fate, but after something like 14.f4 cxd4 15.cxd4 Bxc4-+ it becomes clear that the queen’s placement on a4 is completely incompatible with a kingside attack. 14...dxc5 A move ago White had a nice-looking pawn centre. Now White’s structure looks ugly, and Black went on to win.","black","","","","59","58","59"

The above variation featured a rare case on move 15 where Black’s best option would have been to underpromote to a knight without having a check or fork in mind. Even in that case, Black is still losing. 15...Bxb2 16.dxe6! This is strongest, although the straightforward 16.Qxb2 is also clearly better for White.","white","","","","59","59","60"
